For my dissertation work, I traveled to the SSRL at Standford to collect X-Ray spectroscopy data. This data was output in large loops with nested header files.  The individual blocks of data needed to be extracted from theses output files, calibrated and normalized. Once this is done, the indivdual scans are combined to make a 2-d intensity map. useful information can be drawn from horizontal and vertical slices of this map so this routine outputs said slices. Finally in the current version of this program, the resulting map was plotted in GnuPlot. I had technical issues with the map not being a square grid, so the last step of this program was to insert 0 values to make it square. 

Current plans of to rewrite this program in python to better utilize the analysis and plotting features I am now familiar with (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
