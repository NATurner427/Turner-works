If you took classical mechanics, solid state, linear alegbra or a plethora of other courses in college you were likely exposed to the system of springs and masses. Given a set of blocks of given mass and springs of given force constant you could build a set of matrices and solve the eigenvalue problem to be able to describe the motion of the system. The materials I studied are quasi 1-D chains made of alternating platinum and halide (Chloride, Bromide, Iodide). So its a great transferance of this textbook eigenvalue problem. I did just that, following the work of Love et al to calculate the phonon branches of the chains and taking it one step further, calculating the XAFS debye-weller(DW) values for the pt-halide bonds. These calculated DWs were then compared to the values found by my EXAFS analysis.

I plan to convert this to python and try and make it as interactive as possible.
