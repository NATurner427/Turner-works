In my research I used a program called FEFF9 to create theoretical spectra of the materials I studied. This program required positions of each of the individual atoms in the material. To ensure the calculations were as accurate as possible the materials had to be modeled as completely as possible. Most of the materials I stuided had hydrogen as part of their chemical structure. X-ray diffraction, the method used to identify the materials atomic positions has a difficult time accurately positioning hydrogen. Their solution was to not include the hydrogen in their reported structures. It however as important for my work to have the hydrogen included for the purposes of the FEFF9 modeling. 

My solution was that I recognized that some of the materials structures did report the hydrogen positions. They were always positioned as two legs of a tetrahedra about an atom in the material. For all the materials, the other two legs of these tetrahedra had a known orientation. I wrote a routine that used this information to set the position of the hydrogen in the materials that did not have them reported. I used two assumptions. The first was that the tetrahedra were ideal, meaning that the angle between the legs were 109 degrees. Looking at the materials that did report the position of the hydrogen showed that this was a safe assumption to make. The second assumption was setting the length of the hydrogen bonds to what they were reported as in the other materials.
