    "I've been using Google Play Music (GPM) for about 10 years now. I have all the albums I own uploaded to my digital library, I've made playlists for friends and family and myself, and collected all of the playlists of the radio show I used to host in grad school. Recent actions by Google have foreshadowed the shuddering of this service. They have a near identical service, Youtube Music, running in parallel to GPM. They appear to have decided Youtube Music will be there music streaming service and have been phasing GPM out. This puts my music and my playlists in jeoparady. So, I found a way to extract all that info to CSV files.\n",
