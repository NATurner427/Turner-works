    "# RIXS data prep\n",
    "\n",
    "At SLAC, we collected RIXS on platinum halide single crystal samples. These materials are organometallic, meaning they are susceptible to damage due to exposure to the X-ray beam. we needed to balance that with the objective of collecting as much high quality data. When at a beamline, your time is limited and our sample quantity was limited as well. The decision was to take 2 full scans on a single spot on the sample, then translate the the beam spot to an unexposed spot on the sample and run another 2 scans, etc. The 2 scans for each spot need to be kept seperate at least initially since the conditions of the scans are different. We need to see if we can detect a difference between the unexposed first cans on each spot and the 2nd scans for each spot. Along with these two scans, a third t=1 second long scan was collected for normalization purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.a) Extracting raw data from SLAC beamline\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from SLAC is in a large single txt file with nested headers. The first step to analyzing the data is to properly pull the data from this large txt file. The top header with some relevant info about the entire set of data is saved in a header* file. The remaining data is split between the 2 scans of each spot on the crystal exposed to the beam followed by the time scan. These 3 sets of data are seperated into individual data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "splitting these data files also gives us the opportunity to to build a pandas dataframe in preperation to subsequent steps in this process"
