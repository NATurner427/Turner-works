    "## Final version pitch timestamper\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the working version of the pitch timestamper. I have different working versions and iterations in the sandbox notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "This routine takes in a image of the score infographic and finds it via template matching for each frame of the video.\n",
    "The video is over 3 hours long. To cut down on processing time only one frame is grabbed per second of video. \n",
    "After earch pitch is thrown, the top of the infographic is altered to report the speed of the pitch, this is used as the trigger to timestamp for a pitch. \n",
    "A p that is obscured by the speed is what a second template match is focused on. When it is obscured the program logs the time.\n",
    "Tesseract is used to then pull the pitcher name and pitch count from the infographic. This info is used to match up with the baseball savant logs that were pulled that have the type of pitch and outcome of each pitch reported. By joining the two logs, I will have pitch type and outcome connected to the timestamp of each pitch visual and audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tinkering will be requried for every video I use. Hopefully minimal when it comes to tesseract. But I can for see day versus night games forcing changes to the image processing parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, this program was written using a fox sports broadcast. Different broadcasts have different infographics. Differnt infographics mean different ways to trigger the timestamp. Again the hope is they will be minimal. Fox sports has deals with I believe a vast majority of regular season broadcasting rights. One I can think of is Yankees YES network will be different, but I checked and it also flashes the speed of each pitch after its thrown and can be used as a trigger. "
