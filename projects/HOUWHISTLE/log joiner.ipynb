    "The last pitch of the inning is often immediately followed by commercials breaks. This does not give my program time to register that last pitch, leading to the last pitch of every halfing inning typically being missed. When that pitcher returns to the mound the next inning, this would give the program a chance to register the pitch count before the first pitch is thrown. The result is logging the last pitch count of the previous inning as having occured as the first pitch of the current inning. I pull up the savant log and remove these incorrect first pitches. "
